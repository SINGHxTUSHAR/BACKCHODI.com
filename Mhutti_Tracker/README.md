## MHUTTI_TRACKER :

This is a simple web app that counts the frequency of any bad habit and warns you if you exceed the limit per week or month for that habit.

## WorkFlow :

You have to set the limit and track the habit and if you have cheated then simply add the count to the tracker, once that limit is crossed you will be warn and if you outperform and don't perform that bad habit then it creates a streak of good habit for you.

## SCOPE :

We will integrate the LLMs in the future to show the patterns and will perform the analysis of your data to suggest how you can avoid bad habits.
